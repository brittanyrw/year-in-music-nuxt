# Setup for Workshop

> Don't worry! If you fall behind, the main branch has the completed code and the Readme has detailed instructions.

If you would like to code-along during the workshop, you will need the following items:

* Create an account on [contentful.com](https://contentful.com) account. When creating a new account, create an **empty space**. If you already have a space in Contentful, you can add to your existing space. 
* A GitHub account
* [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine
* Ability to use the Command Line (such as the Terminal application on Mac)
* A text editor of some kind (VS Code, Sublime, Atom, etc)
* Start thinking about what your current favorite albums are
